Library project for YRC Summer of Code.

"Database" folder contains an (obsolete) Eclipse project for testing connection with a localhost database. 
It also contains SQL files used to build and populate our database, including dummy data for testing purposes. 
There are also Python scripts used to generate some of those SQL files, keeping them uniform.

"Knjiznica" folder contains a database connection driver for Postgres and some other JARs for custom JavaFX elements in SceneBuilder.
All code for the project is stored there, in another Eclipse project.
